## Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on Apna.co Job Portal Data
### Overview
This project aims to gather job data from the Apna.co job portal using web scraping techniques and perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the collected data. Apna.co is a popular job portal in India, and analyzing its job listings can provide valuable insights into the job market trends and preferences.

### Introduction
Apna.co is a job portal widely used by job seekers and recruiters in India. This project involves scraping job listings from Apna.co using web scraping techniques and then conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the collected data. EDA will involve analyzing various aspects of the job listings such as job titles, locations, salaries, industries, etc., to gain insights into the job market trends.

### Technologies Used
1. Python
2. Beautiful Soup (for web scraping)
3. Pandas
4. Matplotlib
5. Seaborn

### Web Scraping
Web scraping is performed using Beautiful Soup, a Python library for pulling data out of HTML files. The script fetches job listings from Apna.co, extracts relevant information such as job title, location, salary, etc., and stores it in a structured format for further analysis.

### Data Cleaning
The collected data contains inconsistencies, missing values, or irrelevant information. Data cleaning involves removing duplicates, handling missing values, standardizing formats, and ensuring data consistency to prepare it for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves analyzing various aspects of the job listings dataset. This includes:

- Distribution of job titles, work mode, work type and salaries
- Salary trends across different industries
- Popular industries based on salaries
- Most preferable workmodes
  
Insights gained from EDA can help job seekers make informed decisions, assist recruiters in understanding market demands, and provide valuable information for policymakers.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of web scraping job data from Apna.co and performing Exploratory Data Analysis to gain insights into the Indian job market. The findings from this analysis can be used by various stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding job searches, recruitment strategies, and policy-making efforts.
